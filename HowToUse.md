# How to use

If you want to run executable just go into the folder /Executable and run the ./generator

The first time you run it it will generate a `config.json` file that you can change to your hearts content.

**The program also has an option to delete the already generated project _but it will delete everything in the folder_**
If you want to disable this feature you can do so in `config.json` file by setting the `delete:true` to `delete:false`
